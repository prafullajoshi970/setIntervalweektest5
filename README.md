# Dependencies

The component uses the following dependencies:

    React and useState from the react library.
    useEffect from the react library to handle side effects.
    Card, CardHeader, CardBody, CardFooter, Box, Text, Heading, and Link components from the @chakra-ui/react library.



# Functionality

   1. The component initializes a state variable count and sets it to 1 using the useState hook.

    2. It also initializes an empty array data using another useState hook.

   3. The useEffect hook is used to fetch data from the Hacker News API. It runs whenever the count state variable changes. The API URL includes the current count value in the request.

   4. Inside the useEffect hook, the API response is converted to JSON using resp.json(). The data from the response is then added to the existing data state array using the spread operator ([...prevData, ...data.hits]).

   

   5. The setInterval function is used to increment the count value by 1 every 10 seconds.

  6.  The component renders a Box component that contains a list of Card components.

  7.  The Card components represent individual stories and display the story title, URL, creation date, and author.

  8.  The story data is mapped over using the data.map function to generate the list of Card components.

    9. The CardHeader contains a Heading component with the story title.

   10. The CardBody contains a Link component that displays the story URL.

   11. The CardFooter contains a Text component displaying the creation date.

   12. The author name is displayed using a Text component with the color prop set to "red".
